This is my local 'pinterest' collection, a tag-based bookmark system using python and sqlite3. 

It works through Python script and sqlite database.

To add a record, run `python3 shell.py add`. 

Run `sqlite3 bookmarks.db` to enter database interactive mode.

Work in progress, more interactive scripts to be added.
